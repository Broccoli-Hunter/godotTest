# Brick Breaker in Godot Engine

Followed a live Zoom tutorial hosted by SaskGameDev to start learning the basics of Godot engine before Regina's Global Game Jam (2022).

This repo is not hosting the whole project, rather just the files needed to run a GitHub page of the game.

Check out the GitHub page for this repo to try playing the game!
